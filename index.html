 <h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence
    (1) Zero human error
    This is why the adoption of artificial intelligence in various domains has shot up. When you can 
    nullify human errors completely, you get accurate results. The catch is, to program properly.
    
    Machines take accurate decisions based on the previous information that they gather over time while 
    applying certain algorithm sets. Thus, there is a reduction in error and a spike in accuracy.
    
    For instance, Google recently shared on its AI blog about a machine learning method that will work 
    around predicting the weather. Google is going to call it ‘Nowcasting‘ which will predict weather 
    zero tp six hours ahead of time. Google believes by using fewer data and simple methodology, they
     can predict weather more accurately, especially in events like thunderstorms or ones related to 
     precipitation.

    (2) Zero risks
    Putting machines into tasks that can be a danger to humans can pay off well. For instance, enabling 
    machines to deal with natural calamity can result in faster recovery and lesser pressure on human teams.
    
    This idea comes riding high on Google and Harvard’s initiative of developing an AI system that can 
    predict the aftershock locations of an earthquake. After studying over 131,000 earthquakes and its 
    aftershocks, scientists have tested this neural network on 30,000 events. It showed more accuracy in 
    pinpointing aftershock locations when pitted against traditional methods.
